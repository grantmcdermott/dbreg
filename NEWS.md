## dbreg 0.0.2

**IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE:**

The package has been renamed to **dbreg** to better reflect the fact that it
supports multiple database backends. (#4)

Other breaking changes

- The default `vcov` is now "iid". (#2 @grantmcdermott)

New Features 

- The new `dbreg(..., strategy = <strategy>)` argument allows users to choose
  between different acceleration strategies for efficient computation of the
  regression coefficients and standard errors. This includes `"compress"` (the
  old default), as well as `"mundlak"` or `"moments"`. The latter two strategies 
  are newly introduced in **dbreg** v0.0.2 and offer important advantages in the 
  case of true panel data. If an explicit strategy is not provided by the user, 
  then `dbreg()` will invoke some internal heuristics to determine the optimal
  strategy based on the size and structure of the data. (#2 @jamesbrandecon
  and @grantmcdermott)
