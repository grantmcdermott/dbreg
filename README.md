Very fast regressions on big datasets.

## What

**dbreg** is an R package that leverages the power of **d**ata**b**ases to run
**reg**ressions on very large datasets, which may not fit into R's memory. 
Various acceleration strategies allow for highly efficient computation, while 
robust standard errors are computed from sufficient statistics. Our default
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) backend provides a powerful, embedded analytics
engine to get users up and running with minimal effort. Users can also specify
alternative database backends, depending on their computing needs and setup.

The **dbreg** R package is inspired by, and has similar aims to, the
[duckreg](https://github.com/py-econometrics/duckreg) Python package.
This implementation offers some idiomatic, R-focused features like a formula
interface and "pretty" print methods. But the two packages should otherwise
be very similar.

## Install

**dbreg** can be installed from
[R-universe](https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev/).

```r
install.packages("dbreg", repos = "https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev")
```

## Quickstart

### Small dataset

To get ourselves situated, we'll first demonstrate by using an in-memory R
dataset.

```r
library(dbreg)
library(fixest)   # for data and comparison

data("trade", package = "fixest")

dbreg(Euros ~ dist_km | Destination + Origin, data = trade, vcov = 'hc1')
#> [dbreg] Estimating compression ratio...
#> [dbreg] Data has 38,325 rows and 210 unique FE groups.
#> [dbreg] Using strategy: compress
#> [dbreg] Executing compress strategy SQL
#> 
#> Compressed OLS estimation, Dep. Var.: Euros 
#> Observations.: 38,325 (original) | 210 (compressed) 
#> Standard-errors: Heteroskedasticity-robust
#>         Estimate Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)    
#> dist_km -45709.8    1195.84 -38.224 < 2.2e-16 ***
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

Behind the scenes, **dbreg** has compressed the original dataset down from
nearly 40,000 observations to only 210, before running the final (weighted)
regression on this much smaller data object. This compression procedure trick
follows [Wang _et. al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2102.11297) and
effectively allows us to compute on a much lighter object, saving time and
memory. We can confirm that it still gives the same result as running 
`fixest::feols` on the full dataset:

```r
feols(Euros ~ dist_km | Destination + Origin, data = trade, vcov = 'hc1')
#> OLS estimation, Dep. Var.: Euros
#> Observations: 38,325
#> Fixed-effects: Destination: 15,  Origin: 15
#> Standard-errors: Heteroskedasticity-robust 
#>         Estimate Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)    
#> dist_km -45709.8    1195.84 -38.224 < 2.2e-16 ***
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
#> RMSE: 124,221,786.3     Adj. R2: 0.215289
#>                       Within R2: 0.025914
```

### Big dataset

For a more appropriate **dbreg** use-case, let's run a regression on some NYC
taxi data. (Download instructions
[here](https://grantmcdermott.com/duckdb-polars/requirements.html).)
The dataset that we're working with here is about 180 million rows deep and
takes up 8.5 GB on disk (compressed).[^1]
**dbreg** offers two basic ways to analyse and interact with data of this size.

#### Option 1: "On-the-fly"

Use the `path` argument to read the data directly from disk and perform the
compression computation in an ephemeral DuckDB connection. This requires that
the data are small enough to fit into RAM... but please note that "small enough"
is a relative concept. Thanks to DuckDB's incredible efficiency, your RAM should
be able to handle very large datasets that would otherwise crash your R session,
and require only a fraction of the computation time.

```r
dbreg(
   tip_amount ~ fare_amount + passenger_count | month + vendor_name,
   path = "read_parquet('nyc-taxi/**/*.parquet')", ## path to hive-partitioned dataset
   vcov = "hc1"
)
#> [dbreg] Estimating compression ratio...
#> [dbreg] Data has 178,544,324 rows and 24 unique FE groups.
#> [dbreg] Using strategy: compress
#> [dbreg] Executing compress strategy SQL
#> 
#> Compressed OLS estimation, Dep. Var.: tip_amount 
#> Observations.: 178,544,324 (original) | 70,782 (compressed)
#> Standard Errors: Heteroskedasticity-robust
#>                  Estimate Std. Error  t value  Pr(>|t|)    
#> fare_amount      0.106744   0.000068 1564.742 < 2.2e-16 ***
#> passenger_count -0.029086   0.000106 -273.866 < 2.2e-16 ***
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

Note the size of the original dataset, which is nearly 180 million rows, versus
the compressed dataset, which is down to only 70k. On my laptop (M4 MacBook Pro)
this regression completes in **under 2 seconds**... and that includes the time
it took to determine an optimal estimation strategy, as well as read the data from
disk![^2]

#### Option 2: Persistent database

While querying on-the-fly with our default DuckDB backend is both convenient and 
extremely performant, you can also run regressions against existing tables in a  
persistent database connection. This could be DuckDB, but it could also be any
other [supported backend](https://github.com/r-dbi/backends#readme).
All you need do is specify the appropriate `conn` and `table` arguments.

```r
# load the DBI package to connect to a persistent database
library(DBI)

# create connection to persistent DuckDB database (could be any supported backend)
con = dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = "nyc.db")

# create a 'taxi' table in our new nyc.db database from our parquet dataset
dbExecute(
   con,
   "
   CREATE TABLE taxi AS
      FROM read_parquet('nyc-taxi/**/*.parquet')
      SELECT tip_amount, fare_amount, passenger_count, month, vendor_name
   "
)

# now run our regression against this conn+table combo
dbreg(
   tip_amount ~ fare_amount + passenger_count | month + vendor_name,
   conn = con,     # database connection,
   table = "taxi", # table name
   vcov = "hc1"
)
#> [dbreg] Estimating compression ratio...
#> [dbreg] Data has 178,544,324 rows and 24 unique FE groups.
#> [dbreg] Using strategy: compress
#> [dbreg] Executing compress strategy SQL
#> 
#> Compressed OLS estimation, Dep. Var.: tip_amount 
#> Observations.: 178,544,324 (original) | 70,782 (compressed) 
#> Standard Errors: Heteroskedasticity-robust
#>                  Estimate Std. Error  t value  Pr(>|t|)    
#> fare_amount      0.106744   0.000068 1564.742 < 2.2e-16 ***
#> passenger_count -0.029086   0.000106 -273.866 < 2.2e-16 ***
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

# Result: we get the same coefficient estimates as earlier

# (optional clean-up)
dbRemoveTable(con, "taxi")
dbDisconnect(con)
unlink("nyc.db") # remove from disk
```


[^1]: Depending on your computer and what else you have going on, just trying to 
   load this raw dataset into R could cause your whole system to crash.

[^2]: If we skipped the automatic strategy determination by providing an
   explicit strategy, then the total computation time drops to
   _less than 1 second_...
