\usage{
\method{predict}{dbreg}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  interval = c("none", "confidence", "prediction"),
  level = 0.95,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{dbreg} object.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame for predictions. Required for objects that were
estimated using the \code{"mundlak"} and \code{"moments"} strategies, since \code{dbreg}
does not retain any data for these estimations.}

\item{interval}{Type of interval to compute: \code{"none"} (default),
\code{"confidence"}, or \code{"prediction"}. Note that \code{"confidence"} intervals
reflect uncertainty in the estimated mean, while \code{"prediction"} intervals
additionally account for residual variance. See
\code{\link[stats]{predict.lm}} for details.}

\item{level}{Confidence level for intervals. Default is 0.95.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}

\section{Predicting on "demean" strategy objects}{


Predicting on \code{dbreg} objects should generally work as expected. However,
predictions from \code{"demean"} strategy models carry two important caveats:
\enumerate{
\item Predictions require group means to transform back to the original scale.
If \code{newdata} contains the outcome variable, group means are computed from
\code{newdata} and used to return level predictions. If the outcome is absent,
within-group predictions (deviations from group means) are returned instead,
with a message.
\item Confidence/prediction intervals are not supported. A demeaned model cannot
account for uncertainty in the fixed-effects (since these were absorbed at
estimation time), which in turn would yield intervals that are too narrow.
Requesting intervals for \code{"demean"} strategy models will return point
predictions with a message. Users should re-estimate with a different
strategy if intervals are needed.
