\usage{
\method{predict}{dbreg}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  interval = c("none", "confidence", "prediction"),
  level = 0.95,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `dbreg` object.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame for predictions. Required for objects that were
estimated using the `"mundlak"` and `"moments"` strategies, since `dbreg`
does not retain any data for these estimations.}

\item{interval}{Type of interval to compute: `"none"` (default), 
`"confidence"`, or `"prediction"`. Note that `"confidence"`` intervals
reflect uncertainty in the estimated mean, while `"prediction"` intervals
additionally account for residual variance. See
\code{\link[stats]{predict.lm}} for details.}

\item{level}{Confidence level for intervals. Default is 0.95.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}

\section{Demean strategy predictions}{

For models estimated with `strategy = "demean"`, predictions require
group means to transform back to the original scale. If `newdata` contains
the outcome variable, group means are computed from `newdata` and used to
return level predictions. If the outcome is absent, within-group predictions
(deviations from group means) are returned instead, with a message.
