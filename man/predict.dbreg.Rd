\usage{
\method{predict}{dbreg}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  interval = c("none", "confidence", "prediction"),
  level = 0.95,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `dbreg` object.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame for predictions. Required for objects that were
estimated using the `"mundlak"` and `"moments"` strategies, since `dbreg`
does not retain any data for these estimations.}

\item{interval}{Type of interval to compute: `"none"` (default), 
`"confidence"`, or `"prediction"`. Note that `"confidence"` intervals
reflect uncertainty in the estimated mean, while `"prediction"` intervals
additionally account for residual variance. See
\code{\link[stats]{predict.lm}} for details.}

\item{level}{Confidence level for intervals. Default is 0.95.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}

\section{Predicting on "demean" strategy objects}{


Predicting on `dbreg` objects should generally work as expected. However,
predictions from `"demean"` strategy models carry two important caveats:

1. Predictions require group means to transform back to the original scale.
If `newdata` contains the outcome variable, group means are computed from
`newdata` and used to return level predictions. If the outcome is absent,
within-group predictions (deviations from group means) are returned instead,
with a message.

2. Confidence/prediction intervals are not supported. A demeaned model cannot
account for uncertainty in the fixed-effects (since these were absorbed at
estimation time), which in turn would yield intervals that are too narrow.
Requesting intervals for `"demean"` strategy models will return point
predictions with a message. Users should re-estimate with a different
strategy if intervals are needed.
