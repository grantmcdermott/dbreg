**Future enhancement:** Once predict.dbreg() is implemented, this function
can be extended to provide dense predictions for degree >= 1, especially 
quadratic fits. The approach would be:

1. Store the dbreg fit object in the output (e.g., as an attribute)
2. For each bin, create a sequence of x values: seq(x_left, x_right, length.out = 50)
3. Build newdata with these x values + corresponding bin indicators
4. Call predict(fit, newdata = newdata) to get dense y predictions
5. Return as a list-column or separate dense output option

This would enable smooth curve plotting for quadratic fits instead of just
showing segment endpoints (y_left, y_right).
