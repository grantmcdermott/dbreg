\usage{
construct_output(inputs, fit, geo, V_beta = NULL)
}
\description{
Construct output tibble from fitted model
}
\details{
For degree >= 2 (quadratic), the function evaluates the piecewise polynomial
at three points per bin: left boundary, midpoint, and right boundary. This
provides sufficient information to reconstruct the quadratic curve within
each bin using Lagrange interpolation.
