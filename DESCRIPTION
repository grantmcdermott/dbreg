Description: Leverages the power of DuckDB to run regressions on very large
  datasets, which may not fit into R's memory. The core procedure follows Wong
  et al. (2021) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2102.11297> by reducing ("compressing") the
  data to a set of summary statistics and then running frequency-weighted least
  squares on this smaller dataset. Robust standard errors are computed from
  sufficient statistics, while clustered standard errors are computed using the
  cluster bootstrap.
